# ASSR-Anime-Sign-Song-Ripper-
App designed to take ASS(SubStation Alpha) subtitle from anime subtitle and create subtitle for only sign and songs
ASS(SubStation Alpha) subtitle have tags in it, most of the cases anime Signs and Songs have it own styles and main dialoge have it own, what this app does you select the tag that you want to remove which is main dialoge and the text with certain tag you selected  to be removed that will do the trick, its not %100 acurate but its better than nothing. 


if you are using ASS files so you don't need anything 

1.just open the app load ASS subtitle 

2. open tag to remove and remove subtitles that tagged for main speach such as defualt or main checking it with notepad or subtitle edit would be great help  

3. start ripping 

4.output file would be inside subtitle folder you just opened 


as for mkv files you need to have FFprobe and mkvtoolnix on your PC, from pc locate both of them and you are good to go
mkv files procedure are the same as subtitles files the output will be mkvfile inside same folder of mkv file with add text AS

future plan:
add Linux support
Known bugs
if ffprobe or mkvtoolnix did't found it will crash

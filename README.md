# ASSR-Anime-Sign-Song-Ripper-
App designed to take ASS(SubStation Alpha) subtitle from anime subtitle and create subtitle for only sign and songs

if you are using ASS files so you don't need anything 

1.just open the app load ASS subtitle 

2. open tag to remove and remove subtitles that tagged for main speach such as defualt or main checking it with notepad or subtitle edit would be great help  

3. start ripping 

4.output file would be inside subtitle folder you just opened 


as for mkv files you need to have FFprobe and mkvtoolnix on your PC, from pc locate both of them and you are good to go
mkv files procedure are the same as subtitles files the output will be mkvfile inside same folder of mkv file with add text AS

future plan:
add Linux support
